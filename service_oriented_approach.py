# Most non-trivial web apps use services
# They use serivices from other apps
# Services publish the "rules" applications must follow to make
# use of the service (API)

# Two systems cooperate and split the problem
# As the dta/service becomes useful - multiple applications
# want to use the information/ application

# (API) - Application Program Interface
# The compute resources to run these APIs are not "free"
# The data is valuable
# The data providers might limit the number of request per day, or
# demand an API "key" or even charge for usage
